Ruby wrapper for pjsip library.
You must heave pjsip library compiled and installed.
This have be modified to support debian 6.0.4
also added a simple send_im method for sending out im message

For other linux distro/ osx (UNIX-like system), please edit the extconf.rb targetName to corresponding pjsip library (it should work)
If you find make error while building the shared library,
something like "relocation R_X86_64_32 against `pjsua_var' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC"
You may have to re-compile the pjsip library again and add -fPIC as FLAG

$ ./configure CFLAGS=-fPIC CXXFLAGS=-fPIC
$ make dep && make


Some simple guideline:
compile pjsip on your system
modify extconf.rb depend on your system
change cfg.port in pjmanager.c to your preferred outgoing port if neccessary, currently is 55060
$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make
now you should have the .so / .bundle shared library file
you may want to "$ make install" them
and test with "$ ruby test_pjsip.rb" to see if it is work
(please modify the test_pjsip.rb with some working sip account)
